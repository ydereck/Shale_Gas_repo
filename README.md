Shale Gas Project

This repository builds a reproducible pipeline for:

Cleaning and merging EIA 860 (capacity) and EIA 923 (generation)

Assigning county FIPS codes to each plant

Merging shale potential measures from Rystad/Bartik (2019)

Running county-year regressions on capacity outcomes

Large datasets are handled using Git LFS.
